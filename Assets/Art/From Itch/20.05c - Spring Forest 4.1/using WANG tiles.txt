The included "summer forest wang tiles" image has every single permutation of 6 different ground textures with a mminimum unit size of 2x2 tiles.
I've already set all this up in the TSX file, so all you need to do is select a terrain brush and draw any ground texture.
All textures will seamlessly blend with all other ground textures if you use the terrain brushes.

You'll run into problems when you add different elevations into the mix, so you'll still need to place your cliff tiles manually.

One quirk of Tiled's WANG brushes, is that you can't draw them on an empty canvas.
You must first fill the space with one of the tiles from the wang tileset.
So just use the paint bucket to fill an area with grass, dirt, or water, then start drawing with the brushes.
