TMX and TSX are file types associated with Tiled, a free tilemap editor.
Download it (100% free) here: https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled

Tiled is an excellent, feature rich, and FREE map editor. I recommend it over whatever you're using now.
Build your maps in Tiled, then import/export them into whatever game engine you're using.
Search online for "Tiled to XYZ" where XYZ is whatever game engine you're using.
There are Tiled importers for Unity, Godot, GameMaker Studio, Unreal Engine, RPG Maker, and maybe more.

TMX is a map file. Open these in Tiled to examine the sample maps I've made for you.
TSX are your tileset files, every image needs an associated TSX for use in Tiled.
When you open one of my maps, it should automatically find the associated TSX files used in the map.
But if the map has red exes all over it, you'll need to tell Tiled where the TSX files are (hint: they're in the "TSX files" folder).
You might then need to tell it where the images are (the PNGs with the art).
Just click on the prompt at the top of the Tiled editor to rectify any reference errors.
You can make your own TSX files from within Tiled, but I recommend loading up mine first.
My TSX files will have the appropriate tile sizes and terrain brushes already setup, a boon for new users.
